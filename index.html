            <h2>Nick Sullivan, Creationeer</h2>
            <p>Creationeer is a word I created that combines creation and engineer, which I think describes what I do.</p>
            <p>As a computer programmer, I build software and develop technology that simplifies peoples' lives. Over the years, I’ve focused on web-based product development, spanning the full range of initiatives from concept creation to large-scale rollout. I’ve lead development, user interface and systems administration teams, and founded my own companies.
            </p>
            <p>
            My rare blend of strong communication skills, intelligence, and passion serves me well as a seasoned technology professional. It affords me the opportunity to understand how people think and then develop the solution that best solves the problem. My goal is to enlighten computers with the knowledge of how the human brain works. The more they learn about us, the easier our lives will be.</p>

His ability to uncover the technical needs of an organization and implement a plan from the ground up to meet them is unmatched in any other technical lead I have met.</div>

                      I know that there have been a few times - since I've been at Adicio - where something was a cluster-**** until we got you involved. There have been several occasions where you were able to take a grim technical situation, look over it logically and, ultimately, provide a sound fix while ensuring the fix was better than anyone else could have done it. I think that's your most valuable trait. Your ability to be able to take a difficult situation and reveling at the opportunity of fixing it better than anyone else...any of these companies would be fortunate to have you on their staff.</div>

He was (in many ways still is) the brains behind the product for many years at Adicio. I admire his dedication, his intelligence, his strength and independence, and his ability to persevere. Nick is one of those people who can calmly rescue a system from a fatal crash one minute, and then direct the architecture of a complex feature in the next. Nick would be a valuable addition to any technology company looking to enter into new markets.</div>

He was able to deliver on one of Yahoo's most important projects very efficiently. In this project, I have seen him solve some of the most difficult problems. He is a natural problem solver and I am inspired by his expert knowledge in software architecture. He is certainly the go-to guy when you need to scale your application to billions of users. If I could define a software superstar in this competitive software industry, it would be Nick. I look forward in working with Nick again someday! I also hope that he will write a book someday to share his expertise with the world.</div>

I recognized him as a top flight engineer but we got a lot more than we knew at the time. Quite simply, he's one of those guys you hire that's a x15. In terms of effectiveness, he's worth 15 normal engineers. It's a combination of being very deep in his field but also bringing insight into the equation... which makes him very effective. Adding on to that the patience to listen all the way through a problem, whether technical or organizational, before suggesting a course of action makes Nick one of the top guys in the valley.</div>

It's not even his mastery of technology - both operations and development - nor his ability to get massive amounts of work done. The most rare of traits among alpha-geeks, is the capacity to understand other human beings and therefore conduct oneself in the most appropriate manner conducive to motivating, helping, and guiding others.
